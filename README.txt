Informatics Engineering never be apart from programming terms. Industry in the informatic’s field both in the national and international scope always need people who are expert in programming but it’s hard to be an expert programmer. Learning programming is difficult, it needs precision, logic, and must memorize the syntax and the rules of programming language and its relevant. According in a research, took 10 years for novice programmers to become the expert ones. The education system in developed countries are already anticipating this problem, the programming language already introduced to children from kindergarten and elementary school, such as puzzle, logic games, and many others. Eg : Scratch, Greenfoot, App Inventor, waterbearlang, and google Blockly.
From the reason above, we develop a visual programming language called IndoBlockly that derived from google Blockly. By using this application user doesn’t feel coding but looks like arrange puzzle. Our slogan is, "Anyone can become programmer by IndoBlockly". It equipped with C and Pascal generators, blocks which are constructed by user can be converted into C or Pascal source code directly.
